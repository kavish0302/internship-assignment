# ColorFinder---Python

# Color Extractor:
A Python script that extracts the dominant colors from images using KMeans clustering. The extracted colors are returned in a structured JSON format.

## Features:
- Extracts dominant colors from JPEG images.
- Outputs colors in a human-readable JSON format.

## Requirements:
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python packages:
- Pillow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation:
**Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/kavish0302/ColorFinder---Python>
cd <Color_Finder>
```

**Install Required Packages**:
```bash
pip3 install Pillow numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage:
Prepare Your Images:
Place your images in the same directory as the script. The script currently looks for Sample1.jpg and Sample2.jpg.

Run the Script:
Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:
```bash
python3 colorextractor.py
```

## View the Output:
The script will print the extracted colors in JSON format to the console. The output will look something like this:

```json
{
   "images": [
       {
           "image_name": "Sample1.jpg",
           "colors": [
               "RGB(123, 45, 67)",
               "RGB(255, 220, 180)",
               "RGB(100, 120, 130)",
               "RGB(90, 60, 40)"
           ]
       },
       {
           "image_name": "Sample2.jpg",
           "colors": [
               "RGB(200, 150, 100)",
               "RGB(50, 80, 90)",
               "RGB(255, 0, 0)",
               "RGB(0, 255, 0)"
           ]
       }
   ]
}
```

## Testing:
To test the script, you can use any JPEG images. Ensure they are named Sample1.jpg and Sample2.jpg, or modify the image_paths list in the script to point to your images.
